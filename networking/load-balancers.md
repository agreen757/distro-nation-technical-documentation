## API Gateway Load Balancing Patterns

### Lambda Integration Patterns
```yaml
Lambda Proxy Integration:
   Pattern: API Gateway â†’ Lambda Function
   Load Balancing: AWS managed automatic distribution
   Scaling: Event-driven, up to account concurrency limits

Benefits:
   - No infrastructure management
   - Automatic scaling and load distribution
   - Cost-effective for variable workloads
   - Built-in fault tolerance

Limitations:
   - 29-second timeout limit
   - Cold start latency
   - Limited concurrent execution control
