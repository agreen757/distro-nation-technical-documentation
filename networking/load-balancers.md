# Load Balancer Configuration

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation of Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB) configurations within Distro Nation's AWS infrastructure.

    - New Connections: ~100/second → 0.1 LCU
    - Active Connections: ~500 average → 0.5 LCU
    - HTTP Requests: ~1000/second → 0.1 LCU
    - Data Processed: ~50 MB/hour → minimal LCU
    
  Total LCU Usage: ~0.7 LCU average
  LCU Cost: $5.04/month (0.7 × $0.008 × 24 × 30)
  
Total Monthly ALB Cost: ~$21.24/month
```

### Optimization Opportunities
```yaml
Cost Optimization Strategies:
  1. Target Group Optimization:
     - Consolidate underutilized target groups

```

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

### Current HA Configuration
```yaml
High Availability Status:
  Multi-AZ Deployment: ✅ ALB spans 3 availability zones
  Target Distribution: ✅ Targets distributed across AZs
  Health Checking: ✅ Automated unhealthy target removal
  Auto Recovery: ✅ Auto Scaling Group automatic replacement
  
Availability Metrics:
  Target Availability: 99.5% (1 instance, single point of failure)
  ALB Availability: 99.99% (AWS SLA)
  DNS Availability: 99.99% (Route53 SLA)
  Overall Availability: 99.5% (limited by single target)
```

### DR Recommendations
```yaml
Disaster Recovery Enhancement:
  1. Multi-Target Deployment:
     - Minimum: 2 targets across different AZs
     - Recommended: 3 targets for full redundancy
     - Cost Impact: +$20-40/month (additional EC2 instances)
     
  2. Cross-Region Load Balancing:
     - Route53 health checks with failover
     - Secondary region deployment (us-west-2)
     - RTO: 5-10 minutes, RPO: 1 hour
     - Cost Impact: +$200-400/month (duplicate infrastructure)
     
  3. Database Failover Integration:
     - Aurora Global Database
     - Cross-region read replicas
     - Automated failover coordination
     - Cost Impact: +$100-200/month
```

## API Gateway Load Balancing Patterns

### Lambda Integration Patterns
```yaml
Lambda Proxy Integration:
  Pattern: API Gateway → Lambda Function
  Load Balancing: AWS managed automatic distribution
  Scaling: Event-driven, up to account concurrency limits
  
Benefits:
  - No infrastructure management
  - Automatic scaling and load distribution
  - Cost-effective for variable workloads
  - Built-in fault tolerance
  
Limitations:
  - 29-second timeout limit
  - Cold start latency
  - Limited concurrent execution control
```

### HTTP Integration Patterns
```yaml
HTTP Proxy Integration:
  Pattern: API Gateway → Application Load Balancer → EC2
  Load Balancing: Dual-layer (API Gateway + ALB)
  Scaling: Manual scaling group management
  
Benefits:
  - Longer request timeout (up to 29 seconds)
  - More control over compute environment
  - Better for long-running processes
  - Easier integration with existing applications
  
Use Cases:
  - File upload/download operations
  - Long-running analytics queries
  - Legacy application integration
```

## Empire Distribution Integration Strategy

### Load Balancer Consolidation Plan
```yaml
Phase 1 - Assessment and Documentation (Weeks 1-2):
  Tasks:
    - Complete load balancer inventory and configuration audit
    - Document current traffic patterns and performance baselines
    - Identify consolidation opportunities
    - Assess Empire Distribution load balancing standards
    
Phase 2 - Optimization and Standardization (Weeks 3-4):
  Tasks:
    - Implement cost optimization recommendations
    - Standardize SSL certificate management
    - Deploy enhanced monitoring and alerting
    - Optimize target group configurations
    
Phase 3 - Empire Integration (Weeks 5-8):
  Tasks:
    - Align load balancer configurations with Empire standards
    - Implement cross-account load balancing (if required)
    - Deploy unified monitoring and management
    - Establish disaster recovery procedures
```

### Integration Architecture Options
```yaml
Option 1 - Maintain Current Architecture:
  Approach: Keep existing ALB with enhanced monitoring
  Benefits: Minimal disruption, lower integration cost
  Limitations: Single-vendor dependency, limited scaling
  
Option 2 - Empire Load Balancer Integration:
  Approach: Integrate with Empire's existing load balancing infrastructure
  Benefits: Unified management, economies of scale
  Challenges: Migration complexity, potential downtime
  
Option 3 - Hybrid Architecture:
  Approach: Maintain application-specific load balancers with centralized monitoring
  Benefits: Application independence, centralized visibility
  Implementation: API Gateway integration with Empire's monitoring systems
```

## Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

    - Backend application errors
    - Security group misconfigurations
  
  Diagnostics:
    - Check target health status
    - Review application logs
    - Verify security group rules
    - Monitor CloudWatch metrics
  
  Resolution:
    - Restart unhealthy targets
    - Fix application-level issues

    fields @timestamp, @message
    | filter @message like /ERROR/
    | sort @timestamp desc
    | limit 100
    
  Network Diagnostics:
    - telnet <alb-dns-name> 80
    - curl -I https://<alb-dns-name>
    - dig <alb-dns-name>
