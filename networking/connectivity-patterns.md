# Network Connectivity Patterns

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation of network connectivity patterns and service-to-service communication within Distro Nation's infrastructure. Understanding these patterns is critical for troubleshooting, performance optimization, and integration planning with Empire Distribution.

## Service Communication Architecture

### High-Level Communication Flow
```yaml
User Request Flow:
  1. Client → CloudFront CDN (Global Edge Locations)
  2. CDN → Application Load Balancer (us-east-1)
  3. ALB → EC2 Instances or API Gateway
  4. API Gateway → Lambda Functions (VPC)
  5. Lambda → Aurora PostgreSQL Database
  6. Lambda → External APIs (YouTube, Spotify, TikTok)

Internal Service Flow:
  1. Lambda Functions → Aurora PostgreSQL (Port 5432)
  2. Lambda Functions → S3 Buckets (HTTPS API)
  3. Lambda Functions → Other Lambda Functions (Event-driven)
  4. EC2 Instances → Aurora PostgreSQL (Port 5432)
  5. Amplify Apps → Lambda Functions (API Gateway)
```

## API Gateway Communication Patterns

### dn-api Gateway Connectivity
```yaml
Gateway Configuration:
  API ID: cjed05n28l
  Endpoint: https://cjed05n28l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  Stage: staging
  
Inbound Connections:
  Source: CloudFront Distribution (E1FZO978Z8RTXO)
  Protocol: HTTPS (Port 443)
  Authentication: API Key (header-based)
  Rate Limiting: AWS default throttling
  
Outbound Connections:
  Target: Lambda Functions (84+ functions)
  Integration Type: AWS_PROXY
  Timeout: 29 seconds
  Retry Logic: Exponential backoff (3 attempts)
  
Connection Patterns:
  Administrative Endpoints:
    /dn_users_list → Lambda: dn_users_list
    /dn_payouts_fetch → Lambda: dn_payouts_fetch
    /send-mail → Lambda: DN_Send_Mail
    
  Data Processing Endpoints:
    /dn_partner_list_korrect → Lambda: dn_partner_list_korrect
    /payout-audit → Lambda: dn_payout_audit
```

```

## Lambda Function Connectivity Patterns

### Database Connectivity Pattern
```yaml
Lambda → Aurora PostgreSQL:
  Connection Protocol: PostgreSQL (TCP)
  Port: 5432
  Connection Pooling: Not implemented (recommended: RDS Proxy)
  SSL/TLS: Required (in-transit encryption)
  
Connection Details:
  Source: Lambda functions in private subnets
  Target: Aurora cluster (database-2-instance-1)
  Network Path: VPC internal routing
  Latency: <10ms within same AZ, <50ms cross-AZ
  
Connection Management:
  Max Connections per Lambda: 16 (default Aurora limit)
  Connection Timeout: 30 seconds
  Idle Timeout: 8 hours (Aurora default)
  Connection Reuse: Limited (cold start creates new connections)
  
Functions with Database Access:
  - POSTGRESQL_LAMBDA (primary database operations)
  - dn_spotify_analytics (analytics data storage)
  - dn_tiktok_analytics (analytics data storage)
  - dn_payouts_fetch (payout data retrieval)

```

### S3 Connectivity Pattern
```yaml
Lambda → S3 Buckets:
  Connection Protocol: HTTPS (AWS API)
  Port: 443
  Endpoint: VPC Endpoint (recommended) or Internet Gateway
  Authentication: IAM roles and policies
  
S3 Access Patterns:
  Audio Storage Access:
    Bucket: distronation-audio
    Operations: GetObject, PutObject
    Lambda Functions: Audio processing, file upload handlers
    
  Upload Storage Access:

  Timeout: 30 seconds (origin request timeout)
  Retry Logic: 3 attempts for failed connections
  SSL/TLS: Full encryption end-to-end
```

## VPC Internal Connectivity

### Inter-Subnet Communication
```yaml
Public to Private Subnet Communication:
  Path: ALB (Public) → Lambda (Private)
  Routing: VPC internal routing table
  Security: Security group rules
  Latency: <1ms (same AZ), <5ms (cross-AZ)
  
Private Subnet Internal Communication:
  Lambda ↔ Lambda: Direct VPC routing
  Lambda ↔ Aurora: Direct VPC routing
  EC2 ↔ Aurora: Direct VPC routing
  
Cross-AZ Communication:
  Availability Zones: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c
  Network Performance: 25 Gbps between AZs
  Data Transfer Cost: $0.01 per GB between AZs
  Latency: 1-2ms typical between AZs
```

### VPC Endpoint Connectivity
```yaml
Current VPC Endpoints:
  Status: Not currently implemented
  Recommended Endpoints:
    S3 VPC Endpoint: Gateway endpoint for S3 access
    DynamoDB VPC Endpoint: Gateway endpoint (if DynamoDB used)
    Lambda VPC Endpoint: Interface endpoint for Lambda invocation
    
Proposed S3 VPC Endpoint:
  Type: Gateway Endpoint
  Route Table: Private subnet route table
  Policy: Allow access to required S3 buckets only
  Cost Savings: ~$20-30/month in NAT Gateway data charges
  
Proposed Lambda VPC Endpoint:
  Type: Interface Endpoint
  Subnets: Private subnets (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c)
  Security Group: Allow HTTPS (443) from Lambda functions
  DNS: Private DNS names enabled
```

## Database Connectivity Patterns

### Aurora PostgreSQL Connectivity
```yaml
Database Cluster Configuration:
  Identifier: database-2-instance-1
  Engine: aurora-postgresql
  Port: 5432
  Multi-AZ: Enabled (serverless automatically manages)
  
Connection Sources:
  Lambda Functions:
    Connection Pool: Individual connections per function instance
    SSL Mode: require
    Connection String: Host-based authentication
    Max Connections: Limited by Aurora connection limits
    
  EC2 Instances:
    Instance: i-0063537094eb961dd (if database access needed)
    Connection Type: Direct PostgreSQL connection
    Security Group: Restricted access from application security group
    
Connection Optimization Recommendations:
  RDS Proxy Implementation:
    Benefits: Connection pooling, automatic failover
    Cost: ~$0.015 per vCPU per hour
    Connection Limit: Up to 100 connections per proxy
    Latency Impact: <1ms additional latency
    
  Connection Pooling Strategy:
    pgBouncer: External connection pooler (if needed)
    Application-level: Connection reuse within Lambda runtime
    Database-level: Aurora connection management
```

## Network Performance Characteristics

### Latency Patterns
```yaml
Service-to-Service Latency:
  CloudFront → ALB: 50-200ms (geographic variation)
  ALB → EC2 Instance: <5ms (same AZ)
  API Gateway → Lambda: <10ms (cold start excluded)
  Lambda → Aurora PostgreSQL: <10ms (same AZ)
  Lambda → S3 (via NAT): <20ms
  Lambda → External APIs: 100-500ms (internet latency)
  
Cold Start Impact:
  Lambda Cold Start: 100-500ms additional latency
  Mitigation: Provisioned concurrency (not currently configured)
  Warm-up Strategies: CloudWatch Events for keep-alive
```

### Throughput Patterns
```yaml
Current Throughput Capacity:
  API Gateway: 10,000 requests per second per account
  Lambda Concurrent Executions: 1,000 (account limit)
  Aurora PostgreSQL: Variable (serverless scaling)
  ALB: 25,000 requests per second per node
  
Bottleneck Analysis:
  Primary Bottleneck: Lambda concurrency limits
  Secondary Bottleneck: Database connection limits
  Tertiary Bottleneck: NAT Gateway bandwidth (45 Gbps)
  
Scaling Patterns:
  Horizontal Scaling: Additional Lambda functions
  Vertical Scaling: Aurora serverless auto-scaling
  Geographic Scaling: CloudFront edge locations
```

## Security and Access Control

### Network Security Boundaries
```yaml
Security Zone Architecture:
  Internet Zone:
    Components: CloudFront, public Route53 records
    Access Control: WAF rules, CloudFront restrictions
    
  DMZ Zone (Public Subnets):
    Components: Application Load Balancer, NAT Gateway
    Access Control: Security groups, NACLs
    
  Application Zone (Private Subnets):
    Components: Lambda functions, EC2 instances
    Access Control: Security groups, IAM roles
    
  Data Zone:
    Components: Aurora PostgreSQL, S3 buckets
    Access Control: Database security groups, S3 bucket policies
```

### Connection Authentication
```yaml
Authentication Methods:
  CloudFront → ALB: No authentication (origin access)
  API Gateway → Lambda: AWS IAM integration
  Lambda → Aurora: IAM database authentication (recommended)
  Lambda → S3: IAM role-based access
  Lambda → External APIs: API keys, OAuth tokens
  
IAM Role-Based Access:
  Lambda Execution Roles: Principle of least privilege
  Cross-Service Permissions: Resource-specific policies
  Temporary Credentials: STS token refresh (automatic)
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Connection Monitoring
```yaml

  API Gateway Metrics:
    - Count: Number of API calls
    - Latency: End-to-end request latency
    - Error: 4XX and 5XX error rates
    - IntegrationLatency: Backend integration time
    
  Lambda Metrics:
    - Duration: Function execution time
    - Errors: Function error count
    - Throttles: Concurrent execution limit hits
