# Security Groups and Network Access Control

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation of AWS Security Groups, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and firewall configurations for Distro Nation's infrastructure. Security Groups act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level, while NACLs provide subnet-level network filtering.

## Security Group Architecture

### Tiered Security Model
```yaml
Security Group Hierarchy:
  Tier 1 - Internet-Facing (Public Subnets):
    - Web-tier security groups
    - Load balancer security groups
    - CloudFront origin access
    
  Tier 2 - Application Layer (Private Subnets):
    - Lambda function security groups
    - API Gateway integration security groups
    - Internal service communication
    
  Tier 3 - Data Layer:
    - Database security groups (Aurora PostgreSQL)
    - Backup and maintenance access
    - Cross-service data access
```

## Firewall Rules by Service

### Web Tier Firewall Rules
```yaml
CloudFront Distributions:
  Allowed Origins: S3 buckets, ALB origins
  Blocked Countries: None (global distribution)
  Rate Limiting: 10,000 requests per 5 minutes per IP
  
Application Load Balancer:
  HTTP → HTTPS Redirect: Automatic
  SSL Termination: CloudFront and ALB
  Sticky Sessions: Not configured
  Connection Draining: 300 seconds
```

### Application Tier Firewall Rules
```yaml
Lambda Functions:
  Execution Environment: VPC (private subnets)
  Internet Access: Via NAT Gateway
  Service Access: VPC Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB)
  
API Gateway:
  Throttling: 10,000 requests per second (burst)
  Authentication: Custom authorizers + API keys
  CORS: Configured per endpoint
  Request Validation: Basic (to be enhanced)
```

### Data Tier Firewall Rules
```yaml
Aurora PostgreSQL:
  Network Isolation: Private subnets only
  Encryption: In-transit and at-rest
  Access Control: IAM database authentication
  Port Access: 5432 from application security groups only
  
S3 Buckets:
  Bucket Policies: Restrict public access
  VPC Endpoints: Cost-optimized internal access
  Cross-Region Replication: Selective buckets
  Lifecycle Policies: Automated data archival
```

## Security Monitoring and Compliance

### Security Group Change Monitoring
```yaml
CloudWatch Events:
  Security Group Changes: Monitored via CloudTrail
  Alerting: SNS notifications for unauthorized changes
  Logging: All security group modifications logged
  
Compliance Checks:
  Automated Scanning: AWS Config rules
  Open Port Detection: Regular security scans
  Compliance Standards: SOC 2 Type II preparation
```

### Network Security Monitoring
```yaml
VPC Flow Logs:
  Status: Not currently enabled
  Recommendation: Enable for security monitoring
  Cost Impact: ~$10-20/month
  Benefit: Complete network traffic visibility
  
Security Scanning:
  Port Scanning: Regular automated scans
  Vulnerability Assessment: Monthly penetration testing
  Intrusion Detection: CloudWatch anomaly detection
```

## Cost Optimization for Security

### Security Group Optimization
```yaml
Current Security Groups: 15-20 estimated
Optimization Opportunities:
  1. Consolidate similar security groups
  2. Remove unused security groups
  3. Optimize rule specificity
  4. Implement security group templates

Cost Impact: Minimal direct cost, operational efficiency gains
Implementation Effort: 1-2 weeks
```

### VPC Endpoint Security
```yaml
VPC Endpoints for Security:
  S3 VPC Endpoint: Avoid internet routing
  DynamoDB VPC Endpoint: Internal AWS traffic
  Lambda VPC Endpoint: Reduce NAT Gateway usage
  
Security Benefits:
  - Traffic remains within AWS network
  - Reduced attack surface
  - No internet gateway dependency
  
Cost Benefits:
  - Reduced NAT Gateway data charges
  - Lower data transfer costs
  - Estimated savings: $15-25/month
```

## Empire Distribution Integration

### Security Standardization Plan
```yaml
Phase 1 - Security Assessment (Weeks 1-2):
  - Complete security group audit
  - Document all firewall rules
  - Identify security gaps and redundancies
  - Baseline security posture assessment
  
Phase 2 - Security Enhancement (Weeks 3-4):
  - Implement missing security controls
  - Enable VPC Flow Logs and monitoring
  - Deploy automated security scanning
  - Create security group templates
  
Phase 3 - Empire Integration (Weeks 5-8):
  - Align security policies with Empire standards
  - Implement cross-account security groups
  - Deploy unified security monitoring
  - Establish security incident response
```

### Cross-Account Security Architecture
```yaml
Empire Integration Security:
  Cross-Account Access:
    - IAM cross-account roles
    - Security group references across accounts
    - Centralized security group management
    
  Unified Security Policies:
    - Standardized security group templates
    - Consistent firewall rule naming
    - Centralized security monitoring
    
  Compliance and Governance:
    - Automated compliance checking
    - Security policy enforcement
    - Regular security assessments
```

## Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

### Common Security Group Issues
```yaml
Issue 1 - Connection Timeouts:
  Symptoms: Lambda functions timing out
  Cause: Missing outbound rules in security groups
  Solution: Add HTTPS (443) outbound rule to 0.0.0.0/0
  
Issue 2 - Database Connection Failures:
  Symptoms: "Connection refused" errors
  Cause: Database security group not allowing Lambda access
  Solution: Add PostgreSQL (5432) inbound rule from Lambda SG
  
Issue 3 - API Gateway 5xx Errors:
  Symptoms: Internal server errors from API Gateway
  Cause: Lambda function network connectivity issues
  Solution: Verify Lambda security group outbound rules
```

### Security Group Validation
```yaml
Validation Commands:
  List Security Groups:
    aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region us-east-1
    
  Check Security Group Rules:
    aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-xxxxxxxxx
    
  Validate Network Connectivity:
    aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --region us-east-1
    
  Test Port Connectivity:
    telnet <target-ip> <port>
    nc -zv <target-ip> <port>
```
