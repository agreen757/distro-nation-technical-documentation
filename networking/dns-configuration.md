## DNS Resolution Patterns

### Internal DNS Resolution
```yaml
VPC Private DNS:
  Internal Resolution:
    - Lambda functions → Aurora PostgreSQL (internal DNS)
    - EC2 instances → RDS endpoints (private DNS)
    - VPC endpoint resolution (AWS services)
    
  Private Hosted Zone Resolution:
    - Amplify environments use private DNS zones
    - Cross-service communication within VPC
    - Internal load balancer resolution
    
DNS Resolution Flow:
  1. VPC DNS Resolver (169.254.169.253)
  2. Private hosted zones (VPC-specific)
  3. Public Route53 zones
  4. External DNS forwarding
```

### External DNS Resolution
```yaml
Public DNS Resolution:
  Client DNS Queries:
    User → DNS Resolver → Route53 Public Zones → AWS Resources
    
  CDN Integration:
    Client → CloudFront Edge → Origin via DNS → ALB/S3
    
  API Access:
    Client → API Gateway Custom Domain → Regional API Gateway
    
Geographic DNS Resolution:
  CloudFront: Anycast DNS resolution to nearest edge
  Route53: Geolocation and latency-based routing (not configured)
  Health Checks: Failover routing (not currently implemented)
```

## SSL Certificate Integration

### Certificate-to-DNS Mapping
```yaml
SSL Certificate Management:
  Primary Wildcard Certificate:
    Domain: *.distronation.com
    Provider: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
    Validation: DNS validation via Route53
    Auto-renewal: Enabled
    
  Certificate DNS Records:
    _acme-challenge.distronation.com:
      Type: CNAME
      Purpose: Certificate validation
      TTL: 300 seconds
      Managed: AWS Certificate Manager
      
  Multi-Domain Certificate Support:
    Subject Alternative Names (SANs):
      - distronation.com
      - *.distronation.com
      - api.distronation.com
      - cdn.distronation.com
```

### Certificate Validation Records
```yaml
DNS Validation Process:
  Certificate Request → ACM generates validation records
  Validation Records → Added to Route53 hosted zone
  Domain Validation → Certificate issued automatically
  
Validation Record Format:
  Record Name: _{random-string}.{domain-name}
  Record Type: CNAME
  Record Value: {validation-string}.acm-validations.aws.
  TTL: 300 seconds (recommended for validation)
```

## Health Checks and Failover

### Route53 Health Checks (Recommended)
```yaml
Application Health Checks:
  ALB Health Check:
    Type: HTTPS
    Resource Path: /health
    Request Interval: 30 seconds
    Failure Threshold: 3 consecutive failures
    
  API Gateway Health Check:
    Type: HTTPS
    Resource Path: /health (if implemented)
    Request Interval: 30 seconds
    Latency Measurement: Enabled
    
Database Health Check:
  Aurora Cluster Health:
    Type: Calculated (based on CloudWatch metrics)
    Metrics: DatabaseConnections, CPUUtilization
    Alarm Integration: CloudWatch alarms
```

### Failover Configuration (Proposed)
```yaml
Disaster Recovery DNS:
  Primary Record (Active):
    Name: api.distronation.com
    Type: ALIAS
    Target: Primary ALB
    Health Check: ALB health check
    Failover: Primary
    
  Secondary Record (Standby):
    Name: api.distronation.com
    Type: ALIAS
    Target: Secondary region ALB
    Health Check: Secondary ALB health check
    Failover: Secondary
    
  Failover Behavior:
    RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 5-10 minutes
    Health Check Frequency: 30 seconds
    DNS TTL: 60 seconds (fast failover)
```

## DNS Performance Optimization

### TTL Configuration Strategy
```yaml
DNS TTL Optimization:
  Application Records:
    A/ALIAS Records: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
    CNAME Records: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
    MX Records: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
    TXT Records: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
    
  CDN Records:
    CloudFront ALIAS: 300 seconds
    Edge Optimization: CloudFront manages edge caching
    
  API Gateway Records:
    Custom Domain ALIAS: 300 seconds
    Regional Endpoint: AWS managed TTL
    
Performance Impact:
  Short TTL: Faster failover, higher DNS query volume
  Long TTL: Reduced DNS queries, slower failover
  Recommended: Balance based on change frequency
```

### DNS Query Optimization
```yaml
Query Pattern Analysis:
  Most Frequent Queries:
    - api.distronation.com (API access)
    - cdn.distronation.com (Asset delivery)
    - app.distronation.com (Web application)
    
  Geographic Distribution:
    - North America: 60% of queries
    - Europe: 25% of queries  
    - Asia-Pacific: 15% of queries
    
Optimization Strategies:
  Route53 Resolver: Reduce recursive lookups
  CloudFront Integration: DNS resolution at edge
  Local DNS Caching: Client-side DNS caching
```
