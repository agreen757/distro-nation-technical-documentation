  Analysis Phase:
    - Investigate root cause using dashboards
    - Correlate with recent deployments or changes
    - Determine impact scope and severity
    
  Response Phase:
    - Implement immediate mitigation if possible
    - Escalate according to severity procedures
    - Communicate status to stakeholders
    
  Resolution Phase:
    - Apply permanent fix
    - Verify system recovery
    - Update monitoring if needed
    
  Post-Incident Phase:
    - Document incident details and timeline
    - Conduct post-mortem for critical incidents
    - Implement preventive measures
```

## Alerting Optimization

### Alert Fatigue Prevention
```yaml
Alert Quality Management:
  Alert Tuning:
    - Review alert thresholds monthly
    - Eliminate noisy alerts that don't require action
    - Implement intelligent alerting with ML-based anomaly detection
    - Use composite alarms to reduce alert volume
    
  Alert Suppression:
    - Maintenance windows with alert suppression
    - Dependency-based alert suppression
    - Scheduled suppression for known events
    
  Alert Prioritization:
    - Business impact-based priority levels
    - Customer-facing vs. internal system priorities
    - Revenue impact assessment for alerts
```

### Performance Optimization
```yaml
Alerting System Performance:
  Notification Delivery:
    - Target delivery time: <2 minutes for critical alerts
    - Redundant notification channels for reliability
    - Backup notification methods for channel failures
    
  Alert Processing:
    - Batch processing for non-critical alerts
    - Intelligent alert grouping and correlation
    - Automated alert resolution for known issues
    
  Monitoring Overhead:
    - Optimize CloudWatch API usage
    - Use metric math for complex calculations
    - Implement efficient metric collection strategies
```
