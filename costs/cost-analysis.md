- Actual usage: 367 ACU-hours vs. estimated continuous operation
- Pausing capability during low-traffic periods

**3. S3 Storage Lower Than Expected**
- Actual storage: 709 GB vs. estimated 2.5TB
- Efficient data lifecycle management already in place
- Lower than expected request volumes

**4. Traffic Patterns**
- Lower than estimated API Gateway usage
- CloudFront usage within free tier suggests moderate traffic
- Lambda invocations within free tier limits

#### Why Some Costs Are Higher

**1. NAT Gateway Costs**
