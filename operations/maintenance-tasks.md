### Processing Objectives

#### Viral Content Detection
The claims report processing analyzes content performance metrics to identify:
- Sudden spikes in view counts or engagement
- Cross-platform viral propagation patterns
- Content that may trigger additional rights claims

#### Dispute Prevention
Early warning system for potential disputes by monitoring:
- Unusual claims patterns on specific content
- Rights conflicts across multiple platforms
- Performance discrepancies that may indicate rights issues
- Content flagged by automated content ID systems

### Data Sources
- YouTube Content ID claims data
- Platform analytics and performance metrics
- Internal content management database
- Rights management system records

### Output and Notifications
- Weekly summary reports of processed claims

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Task execution status monitoring via CloudWatch
- Failed execution alerts with automatic retry logic
- Performance metrics tracking for optimization
- Data quality validation and error reporting

## Additional Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Operations
- Social media analytics collection and processing
- Content metadata synchronization across platforms
- User engagement metrics aggregation

### Weekly Operations
- Claims report processing (detailed above)
