2. **Cost Optimization**: Implement Empire cost management practices
3. **Security Hardening**: Apply Empire security policies across all environments
4. **Tool Integration**: Integrate with Empire deployment and monitoring tools

#### Long-term Strategy (Months 6-12)

2. **Multi-region Deployment**: Implement geographic redundancy
3. **Advanced Automation**: Implement Empire's advanced deployment automation
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize environments for Empire's scale requirements

### 11.2 Risk Mitigation

#### Environment Dependencies
- **Cross-environment Communication**: Document and minimize dependencies
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure data synchronization between environments
- **Service Dependencies**: Map all inter-service dependencies
- **External Integrations**: Validate external service configurations per environment

#### Migration Risks
- **Configuration Drift**: Regular configuration validation and correction
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup and validation procedures
- **Service Disruption**: Gradual migration with rollback capabilities
- **Cost Overruns**: Careful cost monitoring during migration
