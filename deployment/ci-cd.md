# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation for Distro Nation's Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. The deployment architecture leverages AWS Amplify for frontend applications, AWS Lambda for serverless functions, and Infrastructure as Code for resource management across multiple environments.

## Executive Summary

### Pipeline Architecture
- **Frontend Deployments**: AWS Amplify with GitHub integration
- **Backend Deployments**: AWS Lambda with automated packaging
- **Infrastructure**: CloudFormation/CDK for Infrastructure as Code
- **Environments**: Development, Staging, Production deployment pipelines
- **Security**: Automated security scanning and approval workflows

### Deployment Statistics
```yaml
Current Deployment Frequency:
  Frontend: Multiple daily deployments via Amplify
  Backend: Weekly Lambda function updates
  Infrastructure: Monthly infrastructure changes
  
Average Deployment Time:
  Frontend: 5-10 minutes (Amplify build + deploy)
  Backend: 10-15 minutes (Lambda packaging + deployment)
  Infrastructure: 15-30 minutes (CloudFormation stack updates)

## 8. Rollback and Recovery Procedures

### 8.1 Frontend Rollback

#### Amplify Rollback Process
```yaml
Rollback Triggers:
  - High error rates in monitoring
  - User-reported critical issues
  - Failed deployment validation
  - Security vulnerability discovery
  
Rollback Methods:
  1. Amplify Console: Manual rollback to previous build
  2. Git Revert: Revert commit and trigger rebuild
  3. Branch Switch: Deploy from known good branch
  4. Manual Deploy: Upload previous build artifacts
  
Rollback Time: 5-10 minutes for frontend applications
```

### 8.2 Backend Rollback

#### Lambda Function Rollback
```yaml
Version Management:
  - All Lambda functions maintain version history
  - Aliases point to current production version
  - Previous versions retained for rollback
  
Rollback Process:
  1. Identify problematic deployment
  2. Update alias to previous version
  3. Validate functionality
  4. Monitor for stability
  5. Investigate and fix root cause
  
Rollback Time: 2-5 minutes for Lambda functions
```

### 8.3 Database Rollback

#### Aurora PostgreSQL Recovery
```yaml
Point-in-Time Recovery:
  - Automated backups every 5 minutes
  - Retention period: 30 days
  - Recovery to any point within retention
  
Migration Rollback:
  - Maintain rollback scripts for all migrations
  - Test rollback procedures in staging
  - Database snapshot before major changes
  
Recovery Time: 15-30 minutes depending on data size
```
