# Rollback Procedures and Recovery Plans

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive procedures for rolling back deployments and recovering from failures across Distro Nation's hybrid AWS-Firebase architecture. It covers rollback strategies for frontend applications, Lambda functions, infrastructure changes, database migrations, and complete system recovery scenarios.

## Executive Summary

### Rollback Capabilities
- **Frontend Applications**: Instant rollback via Amplify console or Git revert
- **Lambda Functions**: Version-based rollback with alias switching
- **Infrastructure**: CloudFormation stack rollback and drift correction
- **Database**: Point-in-time recovery and migration rollback procedures
- **Configuration**: Secrets and parameter rollback via version control

### Recovery Time Objectives
```yaml
Service Recovery Targets:
  Frontend Applications: 5-10 minutes
  Lambda Functions: 2-5 minutes
  Infrastructure Changes: 15-30 minutes
  Database Recovery: 15-60 minutes (depending on scope)
  Full System Recovery: 2-4 hours
```

## 1. Rollback Strategy Overview

### 1.1 Decision Framework

#### Rollback Triggers
```yaml
Automatic Rollback Triggers:
  - Error rate > 5% for 5 consecutive minutes
  - Response time > 5 seconds (95th percentile)
  - Lambda function timeout rate > 10%
  - Database connection failure rate > 20%
  - Critical security vulnerability detected
  
Manual Rollback Triggers:
  - User-reported critical functionality issues
  - Data corruption detected
  - External dependency failures
  - Compliance violation discovered
  - Business decision to revert changes
```

#### Rollback Authorization Matrix
| Severity | Service Type | Authorization Required | Maximum Rollback Time |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | Any Service | Engineering Lead | Immediate |
| **High** | Production | Senior Developer + Approval | 15 minutes |
| **Medium** | Production | Team Lead | 1 hour |
| **Low** | Non-Production | Developer | Next business day |

### 1.2 Rollback Process Framework

#### Standard Rollback Process
```yaml
Phase 1: Assessment (5-10 minutes)
  1. Incident confirmation and severity assessment
  2. Impact analysis and affected systems identification
  3. Rollback decision and authorization
  4. Team notification and communication plan
  
Phase 2: Execution (Variable by service)
  1. Service-specific rollback execution
  2. Monitoring and validation during rollback
  3. System health checks and verification
  4. User impact assessment and communication
  
Phase 3: Validation (10-15 minutes)
  1. Functional validation of rolled-back services
  2. Performance metrics verification
  3. User acceptance testing (if applicable)
  4. Documentation and incident logging
  
Phase 4: Post-Rollback (Ongoing)
  1. Root cause analysis initiation
  2. Stakeholder communication and updates
  3. Prevention strategy development
  4. Process improvement recommendations
```

## 2. Frontend Application Rollback

### 2.1 AWS Amplify Rollback Procedures

#### Method 1: Amplify Console Rollback
```yaml
Procedure:
  1. Access AWS Amplify Console
  2. Navigate to affected application
  3. Go to "App settings" > "Build history"
  4. Identify last known good build
  5. Click "Redeploy this version"
  6. Monitor deployment progress
  7. Validate application functionality
  
Time Required: 5-8 minutes
Success Rate: 99%+ (unless infrastructure issues)
Prerequisites: Access to AWS Console, identification of good build
```

#### Method 2: Git-Based Rollback
```yaml
Procedure:
  1. Identify problematic commit(s)
  2. Create rollback branch:
     git checkout -b rollback/fix-prod-issue
  3. Revert problematic commit(s):
     git revert <commit-hash> --no-edit
  4. Push rollback branch:
     git push origin rollback/fix-prod-issue
  5. Create pull request to main branch
  6. Merge after review (emergency approval)
  7. Monitor Amplify auto-deployment
  
Time Required: 10-15 minutes
Success Rate: 95% (depends on code conflicts)
Prerequisites: Git access, commit identification
```

#### Method 3: Branch Switching
```yaml
Emergency Procedure:
  1. Identify last stable branch/tag
  2. Update Amplify app configuration:
     - Change branch from "main" to "stable" or specific tag
  3. Trigger manual deployment
  4. Monitor build and deployment
  5. Validate application functionality
  
Time Required: 8-12 minutes
Success Rate: 90% (if stable branch maintained)
Prerequisites: Maintained stable branch, console access
```

### 2.2 Frontend Rollback Validation

#### Functional Validation Checklist
```yaml
Critical Path Testing:

  - REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT
  - REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT
  - REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS
```

## 3. Lambda Function Rollback

### 3.1 Version-Based Rollback

#### Lambda Function Versioning Strategy
```yaml
Version Management:
  - All functions maintain numbered versions
  - $LATEST points to most recent code
  - Production alias points to stable version
  - Previous versions retained for rollback
  
Alias Configuration:
  Production Alias:
    - Points to tested, stable version
    - Used by all production API endpoints
    - Can be updated for instant rollback
  
  Staging Alias:
    - Points to latest tested version
    - Used for pre-production validation
    - Testing ground for new deployments
```

#### Immediate Rollback Procedure
```yaml
Step-by-Step Process:
  1. Identify affected Lambda function(s)
  2. Access AWS Lambda Console or use CLI
  3. Navigate to function > Aliases
  4. Update production alias to previous version:
     aws lambda update-alias \
       --function-name <function-name> \
       --name PROD \
       --function-version <previous-version>
  5. Validate API endpoints functionality
  6. Monitor CloudWatch metrics for 15 minutes
  7. Document rollback in incident log
  
Time Required: 2-5 minutes per function
Success Rate: 99%+ (barring permission issues)
Prerequisites: AWS CLI access, version identification
```

  2. Update CodeDeploy deployment:
     aws deploy stop-deployment \
       --deployment-id <deployment-id> \
       --auto-rollback-enabled
  3. CodeDeploy automatically routes traffic back to blue version
  4. Monitor rollback progress in CodeDeploy console
  5. Validate function performance and error rates

  3. Complete disable if issues persist
  4. Document rollback reasoning and timeline
```

## 7. Emergency Recovery Procedures

### 7.1 Complete System Recovery

#### Disaster Recovery Activation
```yaml
Scenario: Complete System Failure
